#### Description
So, what's the big deal with this?

Proximity uses geolocation to connect its users. It lists the users by the distance that separates the user from the others around him.

Imagine going to a new place where you don't know anyone. Proximity is a great app to start a conversation.
You can even find people with the same interests as you using the "Trends" tab!

This part of the project handles the user interface of the app.
